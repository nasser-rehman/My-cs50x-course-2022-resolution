                                <p>In 2016 I joined the Federal Technological University of Paraná by Cornélio Procópio.
                                    Where I had my first contact with programming and its technologies. Soon after
                                    joining the course I got my first job in the area. Today I have my own company in
                                    the area of information security in addition to doing some work as a freelancer.</p>
                                <p>My favorite hobby today is studying. It's true, I'm happy to be able to study. Being
                                    able to solve problems and seeing things I programmed myself to solve these problems
                                    in action is very pleasant. I also really like electronic games, especially action
                                    shooter and RPG games.</p>
                                <p>CS50 has helped me so far to establish several concepts in programming which I hadn't
                                    really learned until today, not because I didn't see it in my course, but because of
                                    the didactics used in college. I'm very grateful for such an exceptional course and
                                    it's all free.</p>
